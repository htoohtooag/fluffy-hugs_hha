## About

This is a demo project featuring a fun and animated character grid with smooth transitions and a custom main character that changes states. It also includes an animated Japanese Kanji text block and social media links.

I started by using some existing resources from GitHub, but I modified a lot and added my own components and styles. The app is a single page split into three main hero sections focusing on visuals and animations.
